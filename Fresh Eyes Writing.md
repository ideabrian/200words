It looks like writing is easier than we first thought. You start typing, and the words just slide off your fingertips. It's cool like that.

But, what about when we want to do something a little more robust? ( Like what? you might ask ) -- 

Like, say we want to write a book. Or even a well-researched blog post.

Hmmm.. that's not too hard. You still have to start typing.

After that, you'll want to add some structure.
Structure begets purpose: ask-- what's my goal here? What do I want the reader to learn or understand?
Then, as you type, you keep asking: "Do they understand it yet?"

Of course, as you read a book or two or 345 to do proper research on your material, you'll reach a point where you lose "beginner's mind" -- which means you'll need to have some fresh eyes look at it.
It could be your son, your spouse, or your neighbor. Doesn't matter. They have to be willing to help you. That's all.
Once you get those fresh eyes, you then edit it. You'll want to shorten and make the flow better. You'll want to add some lubrication to the understanding.
Above all else -- remove unused words.
